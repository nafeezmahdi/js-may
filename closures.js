// Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope). In other words, these functions 'remember' the environment in which they were created.

// Global Scope
// Any variable declared in the global scope can be accessed from anywhere in your code ‚Äî inside functions, blocks, or other scopes.
// Think of it like a variable that lives ‚Äúon the top of the world‚Äù, visible to everything.

  };

var myFunc = sum();

// When you call sum(), it executes and creates num2 and num3.
// Normally, local variables like num2 should disappear after sum() finishes.
// Then it returns the inner function, which references num1 (global) and num2 (local to sum).
// So instead of destroying num2, JavaScript stores it in a special hidden object attached to the inner function‚Äôs [[Scopes]].
// üëâ That preserved environment = closure.

//
function bankAccount(initialBalance) {

  // This inner function remembers the variable balance, even after bankAccount() has finished running.
  // This inner function references balance from the outer function.
  // Normally, balance would disappear once bankAccount finishes.
  // But because the inner function still needs balance, JavaScript keeps it alive ‚Üí closure.
}

var account = bankAccount(100);
// account holds that inner function (the closure), and when you call account():
// It returns the remembered value of balance ‚Üí 100.

// DevTools shows a live scope reference to the global object, so expanding it always reveals the latest values. Closures are different ‚Äî they preserve a specific environment ([[Scopes]] ‚Üí Closure) even after the outer function ends.

num3 = 6;

console.log(add()); // Output: 13 (6 + 7)
console.dir(add); //
// Closures capture references, not values.
// The function add closes over num3 and num4 ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt store their values, just references them.
// So any changes to num3 or num4 after the function is defined will still be reflected when the function is executed.
